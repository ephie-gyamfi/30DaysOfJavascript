âœ¨ Hi & Welcome to Day One! âœ¨

Technically it is actually Day Two because I was about to start the Day Two Challenge and realised that a write up may be a good idea! ğŸ˜‰

Ok, so the aim of the challenge  was to create a drumkit that can be played by pressing certain keys on your keyboard.

What are Methods?








RATING: ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ/5 - i enjoyed it!
