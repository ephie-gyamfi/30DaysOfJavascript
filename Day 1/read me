âœ¨ Hi & Welcome to Day One! âœ¨

Technically it is actually Day Two because I was about to start the Day Two Challenge and realised that a write up may be a good idea! ðŸ˜‰

Ok, so the aim of the challenge  was to create a drumkit that can be played by pressing certain keys on your keyboard.

The HTML & CSS was kindly already provided, so you were purely just working on adding the JavaScript to code. 

What are Methods?








RATING: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ/5 - i enjoyed it!
